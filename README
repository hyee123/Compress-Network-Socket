socket I/O. The client has connect to the server in which it forks
onto bash. Communication between the two programs is just a communication
with keyboard to bash and bash back to keyboard via an array of pipes
and sockets.

		--compression: enables compression and decompression between server and client
		--port=NUMBER: same as the client
